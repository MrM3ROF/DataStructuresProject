## Budget Tracker - A Tool for Students

This document outlines the design of a budget tracker application aimed at helping students manage their finances.

### Introduction

We have chosen to develop a budget tracker as a project. This program will provide students with a tool to effectively track their income and expenses. The application will offer basic functionalities for:

* Recording income
* Categorizing expenses
* Calculating remaining budget

### Requirements

#### Inputs

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Income | Users can enter their monthly salary as initial income. Additionally, they can add any further income throughout the month, specifying the category for each entry. |
| Expense | Users can record expenses by entering the amount, category, and a unique identifier. This allows them to track all transactions effectively. |
| Income/Expense ID | Users can modify existing transactions by providing the associated ID. This allows them to change the amount, category, or even switch between an income and expense entry.  |

**Note:** You can't use italics or bold within tables in GitHub markdown.

This approach provides basic styling to improve readability without relying on external CSS.
